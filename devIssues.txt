Robin issues
- add absent funcitonality
- finish adding special cases module
- make dashboard a page for marking rows in specific tables as finished ex: tableusersmonth

- Team Leader table issue

to do list:
consult with dave how to implement special holiday (edited friday schedule of team schedule already)



add user information table that contains user Bio GraphS
=======


in LoginOrSignup -- if user team is 0, redirect to a different clocktimesave php that saves
in userschedule instead of teamschedule (fixed)

timestamp special holiday and holiday and normal day all works
need to  finalize details for absent module
need to finalize shit for rest day and NP hours what ever the fuck that is

use jquery to find out if employee worked in 10 pm - 6 am minus hours of if he is 
later than 10 pm


use am and pm to tell if timeout is after 6 am or before 12 am, because of before 12 am then there should be a deduction of hours

deduct amt of hours in NP hours with the normal monthly hours
