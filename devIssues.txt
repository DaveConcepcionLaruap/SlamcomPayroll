- Team Leader table issue

to do list:
put a link to daves system in the sidebar that will connect to his whole system with one
<<<<<<< HEAD
link one primary link to his whole dashboard, dave should do the same thing

in LoginOrSignup -- if user team is 0, redirect to a different clocktimesave php that saves
in userschedule instead of teamschedule

add user information table that contains user Bio GraphS
=======
link one primary link to his whole dashboard, dave should do the same thing (fixed but needs sessions)

in LoginOrSignup -- if user team is 0, redirect to a different clocktimesave php that saves
in userschedule instead of teamschedule (fixed)


prolly just use your login page as admin login, but we should collab to add sessions and shit na
I guess next week


loginsignup.php - maybe separate the onclick of the login from the rest of the table (fixed)
